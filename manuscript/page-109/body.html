What do you mean? That is absurd!”</p><p>The detective continued:</p><p>“At first sight there is a certain resemblance, but if you carefully consider the nose, the mouth, the hair, the color of skin, you will see that it is not ArsÃ¨ne Lupin. And the eyes! Did he ever have those alcoholic eyes!”</p><p>“Come, come, witness! What do you mean? Do you pretend to say that we are trying the wrong man?”</p><p>“In my opinion, yes. ArsÃ¨ne Lupin has, in some manner, contrived to put this poor devil in his place, unless this man is a willing accomplice.”</p><p>This dramatic dÃ©nouement caused much laughter and excitement amongst the spectators. The judge adjourned the trial, and sent for Mon. Bouvier, the gaoler, and guards employed in the prison.</p></div> </div>
