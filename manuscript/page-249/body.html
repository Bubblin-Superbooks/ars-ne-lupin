A message came for my husband while we were at dinner. The servant gave it to me by mistake. My husband grabbed it quickly, but he was too late. I had read it.”</p><p>“You read it?”</p><p>“Yes. It was something like this: ‘At nine o’clock this evening, be at Boulevard Maillot with the papers connected with the affair. In exchange, the letters.’ So, after dinner, I hastened here.”</p><p>“Unknown to your husband?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What do you think about it?” asked Daspry, turning to me.</p><p>“I think as you do, that Mon. Andermatt is one of the invited guests.”</p></div> </div>
