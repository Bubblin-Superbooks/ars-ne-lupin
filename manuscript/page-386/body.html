The compliment pleased him. He shook his head, as he said:</p><p>“A clever man! I knew that when I saw him.”</p><p>“Have you seen him?”</p><p>“I met him a short time ago—on my way from the station.”</p><p>“And you knew it was Horace Velmont—I mean, ArsÃ¨ne Lupin?”</p><p>“That is right. I wonder how it came—”</p><p>“No, but I supposed it was—from a certain ironical speech he made.”</p><p>“And you allowed him to escape?”</p><p>“Of course I did. And yet I had everything on my side, such as five gendarmes who passed us.”</p><p>“Sacrableu!” cried Devanne. “You should have taken advantage of the opportunity.”</p></div> </div>
